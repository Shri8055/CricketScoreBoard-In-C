1) if else validations for heads and tails selection.
2) add dialogies to comentrator.
3) strike * not showing properly.
4) for now i have created two arrays for storing runs and balls played or runs given by bowler and overs done so it will create problem when all rounder bats and baws.
5) substitute players / Impact players.
6) use recursive functions in next batsman selection.
7) double bat / ball check, create recursive function now it has issue because i have used strucutures.
